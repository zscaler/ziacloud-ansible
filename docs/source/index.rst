==========================================
Zscaler Internet Access Ansible Collection
==========================================
The **Zscaler Internet Access Ansible collection**, also represented as **ziacloud** in this document,
is a collection of modules that automate configuration and operational tasks on Zscaler Internet Access Cloud.
This collection is part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible Automation to Zscaler Zero Trust Platform through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content**.

Version: 2.0.4

Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for Zscaler
=============================================
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for Zscaler Internet Access** provides the ability to
connect Zscaler's platform' wider enterprise automation strategy through the
Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. This enables development and operations
automation on Zscaler's platform through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, in
one easy-to-use platform.

The **Zscaler Internet Access Collection** is following the
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content** method of distributing
content. Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready
for use it is released to
`Ansible Galaxy`_
for community adoption. Once contributors review community usage, feedback,
and are satisfied with the content published, the collection will then be
released to `Ansible Automation Hub`_
as **certified** and **Zscaler supported** for
**Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscribers**. 

For guides and reference, please review the `documentation`_.

Features
========
The **Zscaler Internet Access Collection**, includes
`modules`_ and ansible-doc to automate tasks on the Zscaler platform.

Sample playbooks are available in our `samples repository`_
contributed by the **Zscaler's Technology Alliances** team.

Support
=======
As of version 1.0.0, this Collection of Ansible Modules for Zscaler Internet Access is
`certified on Ansible Automation Hub <https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/zscaler/ziacloud>`_,
and officially supported for Ansible subscribers. Ansible subscribers can engage
for support through their usual route towards Red Hat.

For those who are not Ansible subscribers, this Collection of Ansible Modules is
also `published on Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/zscaler/ziacloud>`_,
to be freely used under an as-is, best effort, support
policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and Zscaler
Technology Alliances Team will contribute our expertise as and when possible.
We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components
of the project through our normal support options such as Zscaler support teams,
or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline
support options. The underlying product used (Zscaler Private Access API) but the
scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the
product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or
script itself.

Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our
`GitHub repository <https://https://github.com/zscaler>`_ or sites other
`Downloads page <https://help.zscaler.com/login-tickets>`_ than our official
are provided under the best effort policy.

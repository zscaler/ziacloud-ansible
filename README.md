## Zscaler Support

-> **Disclaimer:** Please refer to our [General Support Statement](https://zscaler.github.io/ziacloud-ansible/support.html) before proceeding with the use of this collection. You can also refer to our [troubleshooting guide](https://zscaler.github.io/ziacloud-ansible/troubleshooting.html) for guidance on typical problems.

This collection contains modules and plugins to assist in automating the configuration and operational tasks on Zscaler Internet Access cloud, and API interactions with Ansible.

- Free software: [MIT License](https://github.com/zscaler/ziacloud-ansible/blob/master/LICENSE)
- [Documentation](https://zscaler.github.io/ziacloud-ansible)
- [Repository](https://github.com/zscaler/ziacloud-ansible)
- [Example Playbooks](https://github.com/zscaler/ziacloud-playbooks)

## Tested Ansible Versions

This collection is tested with the most current Ansible releases. Ansible versions
before 2.15 are **not supported**.

## Python dependencies

The minimum python version for this collection is python `3.9`.

The Python module dependencies are not automatically handled by `ansible-galaxy`. To manually install these dependencies, you have the following options:

1. Utilize the `requirements.txt` file located [here](https://github.com/zscaler/ziacloud-ansible/blob/master/requirements.txt) to install all required packages:

  ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

2. Alternatively, install the [Zscaler SDK Python](https://pypi.org/project/zscaler-sdk-python/) package directly:

  ```sh
    pip install zscaler-sdk-python
  ```

## Installation

Install this collection using the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install zscaler.ziacloud
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
  collections:
    - zscaler.ziacloud
```

## Using modules from the ziacloud Collection in your playbooks

It's preferable to use content in this collection using their [Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN)](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/rules/fqcn/), for example `zscaler.ziacloud.zia_cloud_firewall_filtering_rule`:

```yaml
---
- name: ZIA Cloud Firewall Rule
  hosts: localhost

  vars:
    zia_cloud:
      client_id: "{{ lookup('env', 'ZSCALER_CLIENT_ID') }}"
      client_secret: "{{ lookup('env', 'ZSCALER_CLIENT_SECRET') }}"
      vanity_domain: "{{ lookup('env', 'ZSCALER_VANITY_DOMAIN') }}"
      cloud: "{{ lookup('env', 'ZSCALER_CLOUD') | default(omit) }}"

  tasks:
    - name: Create/update firewall filtering rule
      zscaler.ziacloud.zia_cloud_firewall_filtering_rule:
        provider: "{{ zia_cloud }}"
        name: "Ansible Example"
        description: "Ansible Example"
        action: "ALLOW"
        rule_state: "ENABLED"
        order: 1
        enable_full_logging: true
        nw_services:
          - "774003"
          - "774013"
      register: created_rule
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ created_rule }}"
```

(Note that [use of the `collections` key is now discouraged](https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/rules/fqcn/))

## Releasing, changelogs, versioning and deprecation

The intended release frequency for major and minor versions are performed whenever there is a need for fixing issues or to address security concerns.

Changelog details are created automatically and more recently can be found [here](./CHANGELOG.md), but also the full history is [here](https://github.com/zscaler/ziacloud-ansible/releases).

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is adhered to for this project.

Deprecations are done by version number, not by date or by age of release. Breaking change deprecations will only be made with major versions.

## Support

The Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) Collection of Ansible Modules is [certified on Ansible Automation Hub](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/zscaler/ziacloud) and officially supported for Ansible subscribers. Ansible subscribers can engage for support through their usual route towards Red Hat.

For those who are not Ansible subscribers, this Collection of Ansible Modules is also [published on Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/zscaler/ziacloud) and also supported via the formal Zscaler suppport process.
